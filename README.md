Preview of GUI (V2):

Thank you for downloading my awesome program ^_^
Here are some basic instructions on how to use it.

Basic stuffs:
-Just run the program (League Typer.exe)
-What the script does is send out two phrases, I like to use one to call my lanes and the other to call some bans
-You can edit the text to whatever you want to auto-type and press start
-The script will not work until you press the start button
-F2 will type phrase 1, F3 will type phrase 2 and F4 will end the process (the script)

I made this because when playing ranked, even normals I got tired of typing the same phrases over and over again so I decided to make an autotyper, also since I'm saying a nice polite sentence instead of just a few words it sets a nicer mood in champion select :)

Another benefit of this (more in normal games than ranked) is that you can call your role extremely fast, but don't spam the keys! You'll get chat limited for a few seconds, just press each phrase once (or twice if needed) and you'll be fine

Note: This program is 100% legal/not a cheat program/hacking program/not against Riot's TOS so there is nothing to worry about

Other features:
-In v2 I've added an INI file (instead of just hard coding some stuff in)
-In the INI file you can change the default messages the program's GUI displays, so if you want to change your preferred roles and bans and press start right away without having to change them every time! Convenient right!
-I've also added an option to disable the GUI all together and run in what I call "Silent Mode"
	-In silent mode basically you run the script and won't see any windows -- It will be running in your background. Same keys apply, F2 for phrase 1 F3 for phrase 2 and F4 to exit (close/terminate/vaporize/end process) the script. The text that will be typed is the default messages that show up in the GUI (And can be edited in settings.ini)
	-I prefer to run in silent-mode, but it's all up to you!
	
Other information:
-This script was made using autohotkey ( http://www.autohotkey.com/ ) a very simple programming language that's awesome for making a basic program
-You do not need autohotkey to run the script since I add a compiled version, but if you want to change around the source (please keep forum link and add your name besides mine <3)
you will need it to compile.
-I add the source because everybody can learn. The source can be found on github :)
-Enjoy the script and most of all your figure strength, save it for the fields of justice!

Change log:
